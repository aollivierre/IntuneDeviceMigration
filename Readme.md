### 1\. **Project Overview**

*   **Title:** _Device Migration Utility (DMU)_
*   **Description:** This utility automates the migration of devices to Azure Active Directory (AAD) and OneDrive with a focus on seamless integration and efficient handling of critical tasks such as module installation, scheduled tasks, and logging. The script supports running in the SYSTEM context to simulate Intune behavior, encrypt sensitive data, and manage scheduled tasks for OneDrive synchronization and migration execution.

### 2\. **Prerequisites**

*   **PowerShell Version:** PowerShell 5 (required for module installation).
    *   The script must be run using PowerShell 5 because the modules are installed in Windows PowerShell, which could cause issues if installed in PowerShell 7.
*   **System Context:** The script should be run under the SYSTEM account when simulating Intune behavior.
*   **Automated Git and GitHub Installation:** The script automates the installation of Git and the GitHub CLI if they are not already installed.
*   **Administrative Permissions:** Necessary to execute the script in the required contexts.

### 3\. **Installation**

*   **Easy Installation Command:** To simplify the process, the script can be run using an `iex` command that will handle downloading the entire GitHub repository, unzipping it, and initiating the required modules and setup:
    
    ```powershell
    iex (irm bit.ly/4h1T0P4)
    ```
    
    This command will:
    *   Download the entire repository.
    *   Install the PSFramework and other necessary modules (including `PSFFramework`, `Install-EnhancedModuleStarterAO`, and custom scripts on the PowerShell Gallery).
    *   Start the script for the user automatically.

### 4\. **Usage Instructions**

*   **Running the Script:** Run the following command to initiate the DMU setup:
    
    ```powershell
    iex (irm bit.ly/4h1T0P4)
    ```
    
    *   This will execute the necessary setup automatically, so no manual downloading or unzipping is required.
*   **Logs:**
    *   Logs are stored locally at `C:\logs`.
    *   **Optional:** Users can choose to upload logs to GitHub by zipping the logs and submitting them.

### 5\. **Features**

*   **Automatic Module Installation:** The script uses the `Install-EnhancedModuleStarterAO` to install essential modules such as `PSFramework` and `Enhanced PS Tools`.
*   **Mutex for Critical Sections:** Mutex locks are used to prevent simultaneous execution of critical sections, such as module installation, ensuring a smooth execution process.
*   **Scheduled Tasks:** Five scheduled tasks are created to manage key migration actions:
    1.  OneDrive sync status.
    2.  Backing up user files to OneDrive.
    3.  Initiating migration via the PowerShell Application Deployment Toolkit (PSADT) v3 (with plans to upgrade to V4 when officially released https://patchmypc.com/psadt-v4)
    4.  Clearing OneDrive cache.
    5.  Post-migration cleanup.
*   **Encryption:** The script encrypts sensitive information if the user opts to upload logs to GitHub. This includes encrypting secrets for secure upload.
*   **Status Pop-up:** A Windows form provides the deviceâ€™s Azure AD and Intune enrollment status. If the device is already Azure AD joined and Intune enrolled, the script exits gracefully.

### 6\. **Logging**

*   **Local Logs:** All logs are stored in `C:\logs` with detailed information on script execution.
*   **Optional GitHub Upload:** Logs can optionally be zipped and uploaded to a designated GitHub repository for further analysis. This feature is controlled by the script and is not mandatory.

### 7\. **Encryption and Decryption (Optional)**

*   **Purpose:** Encrypts sensitive information only when logs are being uploaded to GitHub.
*   **No Encryption Needed for Local Logs:** If logs are kept local, encryption and decryption are not triggered.

### 8\. **Example Workflow**

*   **Initial Setup and Execution:**
    
    ```powershell
    iex (irm 'URL-to-script')
    ```
    
    *   This command will automatically:
        1.  Download the repository.
        2.  Unzip the files.
        3.  Install the required modules (PSFramework, Install-EnhancedModuleStarterAO, and others).
        4.  Execute the script to handle Azure AD migration tasks.
*   **Azure AD and Intune Status:** If the device is already Azure AD joined and enrolled in Intune, a graphical status pop-up will appear, and the script will exit.

### 9\. **Contributing**

*   **Reporting Issues:** You can report issues by submitting them on GitHub.
*   **Pull Requests:** Contributions are welcome through pull requests for enhancements or bug fixes.

### 10\. **Known Issues and Troubleshooting**

*   **PowerShell 7 Incompatibility:** Ensure you are using PowerShell 5, as module installations will fail in PowerShell 7.
*   **Simulating Intune Behavior:** When simulating Intune, ensure the script is run under the SYSTEM account to mimic the expected behavior.
*   **Module Installation:** The script automates module installation, but if any issues arise, check the logs stored in `C:\logs\psf`.

* * *

### Final Considerations:

*   **Remove Dev/Prod References:** Since the utility is primarily for production use, remove references to development modes from the public-facing documentation.
*   **Simplified Execution:** Emphasize the use of the `iex` command for easy script execution, avoiding manual downloads.
*   **GitHub Integration:** Highlight that uploading logs to GitHub is optional but available for advanced users.
