To securely proceed with the decryption flow through **GitHub Secrets**, you will need to store the following files in GitHub Secrets:

### 1. **Base64-encoded Certificate (`cert.pfx.base64`)**
- **File**: `C:\temp\certs\cert.pfx.base64`
- **Purpose**: This file contains your certificate (including the private key) in **Base64** format, which will be needed to decrypt the AES key later.
- **GitHub Secret**: Store this as a **GitHub Secret**. For example, you could name the secret `CERTIFICATE_BASE64`.

### 2. **Encrypted AES Key and IV (`secret.key.encrypted`)**
- **File**: `C:\temp\secret.key.encrypted`
- **Purpose**: This file contains the **AES key and IV** that were encrypted using the certificate’s RSA key. It will be used during decryption to retrieve the AES key, which is required to decrypt the file content.
- **GitHub Secret**: Store this file content in a **GitHub Secret**. You can convert this file to **Base64** and store it similarly to the certificate.
  
   Here’s how you can convert `secret.key.encrypted` to Base64 in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   $keyFilePath = "C:\temp\secret.key.encrypted"
   $keyBytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($keyFilePath)
   $base64Key = [Convert]::ToBase64String($keyBytes)
   
   # Output the Base64 string to store in GitHub Secrets
   $base64Key
   ```
   You can name this GitHub Secret something like `ENCRYPTED_AES_KEY_BASE64`.

### Summary of Files to Store in GitHub Secrets:
1. **Base64-encoded certificate (`cert.pfx.base64`)** → Store as `CERTIFICATE_BASE64`.
2. **Base64-encoded AES key and IV (`secret.key.encrypted`)** → Store as `ENCRYPTED_AES_KEY_BASE64`.

Once these files are stored as GitHub Secrets, we can proceed with building the **decryption flow**, where we will:
1. Fetch the secrets in **GitHub Actions**.
2. Reconstruct the certificate and AES key.
3. Decrypt the AES key.
4. Use the decrypted AES key to decrypt the original file.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed!
